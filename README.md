## Intro

I built this package when I got started working through problems on [CodeForces](https://Codeforces.com). I didnt have a clean way to test my solution to see if it passed the test cases so I would end up uploading my script to have them test it. But thats pretty lazy and slow.

## Install

```
yarn add @pljseksavica27/ctest
```

## Usage

Add this to your package.json scripts like you would any test runner.
